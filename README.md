Search Exclude Plugin by MRK WP

## Intro

The MRK Search Exclude plugin allows you to take control of your site’s search functionality.

Using our plugin, you can exclude pages, posts, or any other custom post types from search results. With our solution, you do not need to write any code.

The MRK Search Exclude Plugin was cloned from the Search Exclude plugin by QuadLayers after we found their plugin filled with a lot of bloatware they use for advertisement inside WP Admin.

We therefore decided to clone their solution and re-develop it removing all the bloatware from their current plugin.
